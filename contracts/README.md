# Contract List

# Deployment Sequence

I am sure there are more eloquent ways to do this but this is my deployment sequence:

* Start Ganache 
* Start VS Code
* * In the terminal window (inside of VS Code - Make sure you the project root folder) run the following commands:
```sh
* * * truffle console
* * * truffle migrate --reset
```


# Helper commands (all the main functions through the CLI)
