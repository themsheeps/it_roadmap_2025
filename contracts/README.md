# Deployment Sequence

I am sure there are more eloquent ways to do this but this is my deployment sequence:

* Start Ganache 
* Start VS Code
* * In the terminal window (inside of VS Code) run the following commands - Make sure you the project root folder:
* * truffle console


# Helper commands (all the main functions through the CLI)
